Grave Encounters is not only a terrifying film, but also a fascinating one. It has many interesting trivia and behind-the-scenes facts that add to its appeal. Here are some of them:
 
- The film was inspired by real-life ghost hunting shows like Ghost Adventures and Paranormal State. The lead character of Lance Preston is based on Zak Bagans, the host of Ghost Adventures, who is known for his aggressive approach to the paranormal.
- The film was shot in only 10 nights and 2 days at Riverview Hospital, a former mental institution in British Columbia that closed in 2012. The hospital has been used as a filming location for many other movies and TV shows, such as Watchmen and The X-Files.
- The directors wanted to make the film more intense and scary than other found footage films, so they decided to show the demons more clearly and have them attack the characters physically. They also used practical effects and makeup instead of CGI for most of the scenes.
- The film has no soundtrack except for the end credits song, FreaXXX by Brokencyde. This was done to create a more realistic and immersive atmosphere for the viewers.
- In one of the rooms of the hospital, there is a book with runes that repeat the same page. The runes are actually an old Norse script that can be translated into English. The text is a parody of a poem called "I've Learned" by an unknown author, and it contains some humorous and cynical statements about life.
- The name of the doctor who performed experiments on the patients, Dr. Arthur Friedkin, is a homage to William Friedkin, the director of The Exorcist.

These are some of the trivia and facts about Grave Encounters that make it a more intriguing and enjoyable film for horror fans.
