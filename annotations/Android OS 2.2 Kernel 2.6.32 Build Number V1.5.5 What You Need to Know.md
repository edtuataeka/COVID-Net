# How to fix an Android tablet stuck on boot screen
 
If you have an Android tablet that runs on OS 2.2 kernel 2.6.32 build number v1.5.5, you may encounter a problem where the device is stuck on the black screen with the Android robot logo. This means that the device cannot load the operating system properly and is in a boot loop.

Fortunately, there is a way to fix this problem by re-flashing the tablet with a new firmware based on the same kernel version. This will erase all your data and settings, so make sure you back up your important files before proceeding.
 
Here are the steps to re-flash your Android tablet:
 
1. Download the UDROIDX 1.5.5 firmware from this link: [http://narod.ru/disk/42649365001/China\_Ipad.rar.html](http://narod.ru/disk/42649365001/China_Ipad.rar.html). This firmware is compatible with many WM8650 powered tablets and has improved features such as Flash Player, WiFi, sound, battery and launcher.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to a blank SD card formatted to FAT32.
3. Choose your env.uboot file under Firmwareinstalle/env according to your device model and rename it to env\_uboot. Delete all the other env files in the directory.
4. Insert the SD card into your tablet and power it on. The upgrade will run automatically and you will see a progress bar on the screen.
5. Once the upgrade is finished, wait for one minute before removing the SD card. The device will reboot and load the new firmware.
6. Be patient and wait for about 4-5 minutes for the system to load completely.

Congratulations! You have successfully fixed your Android tablet stuck on boot screen. Enjoy your new firmware and features.
