# How to Play The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Without a DVD
 
The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion is a popular role-playing game that was released in 2006 for PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The game requires a DVD to run, which can be inconvenient for some players who want to play without inserting the disc every time. Fortunately, there are ways to play Oblivion without a DVD, using either a no-CD patch or a digital download.
 
## No-CD Patch
 
A no-CD patch is a file that modifies the game's executable file to bypass the DVD check. There are several no-CD patches available for Oblivion, depending on the version of the game and the language. Some of the most common ones are:

To use a no-CD patch, you need to download the file that matches your game version and language, and replace the original oblivion.exe file in your game folder with the patched one. You should always make a backup of the original file before doing this, in case something goes wrong or you want to update the game later. You should also disable any antivirus software that might interfere with the patching process.

## Digital Download
 
Another way to play Oblivion without a DVD is to buy a digital copy of the game from an online platform such as Steam or GOG.com. These versions of the game do not require a DVD to run, and they also come with some benefits such as automatic updates, cloud saves and achievements. However, they might also have some drawbacks such as DRM restrictions, compatibility issues or modding limitations.
 
Steam offers the Game of the Year Edition of Oblivion, which includes the base game and two official expansions: Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine. GOG.com offers the Game of the Year Deluxe Edition of Oblivion, which includes the base game, both expansions and nine additional downloadable content packs. Both versions cost $19.99 USD as of April 2023.
 
### Conclusion
 
The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion is a classic RPG that can be played without a DVD using either a no-CD patch or a digital download. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, so it is up to each player to decide which one suits them best. Either way, Oblivion offers a rich and immersive gaming experience that is worth trying.
  
### How to Install and Play Oblivion Mods
 
Oblivion is a game that can be greatly enhanced by mods, which are user-made modifications that add new content, features or improvements to the game. Mods can range from simple tweaks to complete overhauls, and they can make the game more fun, challenging or realistic. However, installing and playing Oblivion mods can be tricky, especially for beginners. Here are some steps to help you get started:

1. Download and install a mod manager. A mod manager is a tool that helps you organize, install and uninstall mods easily. There are several mod managers available for Oblivion, such as Wrye Bash, Nexus Mod Manager or Mod Organizer. You can find them on websites like Nexus Mods or TES Alliance. Choose the one that suits your preferences and follow the instructions to install it.
2. Download and install the mods you want. You can find thousands of Oblivion mods on various websites, such as Nexus Mods, TES Alliance or Planet Elder Scrolls. Browse through the categories and ratings to find the mods that interest you. Read the descriptions and requirements carefully, and make sure they are compatible with your game version and other mods. Download the mods and use your mod manager to install them.
3. Activate and order the mods. After installing the mods, you need to activate them in your mod manager. This will make them load in the game. However, some mods might conflict with each other or overwrite each other's files. To avoid this, you need to order the mods according to their load order. The load order is the sequence in which the mods are loaded in the game, and it determines which mod takes priority over another. You can use tools like BOSS or LOOT to automatically sort your load order, or you can manually adjust it in your mod manager.
4. Launch and play the game. Once you have activated and ordered your mods, you are ready to launch and play Oblivion with mods. You can use your mod manager to launch the game, or use a shortcut or an executable file. Enjoy the new content and features that the mods offer, and have fun exploring Tamriel.

### Tips and Troubleshooting
 
Here are some tips and troubleshooting advice for playing Oblivion with mods:

- Backup your game files before installing any mods. This will allow you to restore your game to its original state if something goes wrong.
- Read the mod descriptions and instructions carefully. Some mods might require additional steps or files to work properly.
- Check for compatibility issues and patches. Some mods might not work well with each other or with the official patches or expansions. Look for compatibility patches or alternative versions that fix these issues.
- Test your mods one by one. If you install multiple mods at once, you might not know which one is causing problems if something goes wrong. Install and test your mods one by one, and check for errors or conflicts.
- Use a clean save game. If you want to start a new game with mods, it is recommended to use a clean save game that has no previous mod data. This will prevent potential errors or corruption.
- Update your mods regularly. Some mods might release new versions or updates that fix bugs or add new features. Check for updates on the mod websites or in your mod manager.
