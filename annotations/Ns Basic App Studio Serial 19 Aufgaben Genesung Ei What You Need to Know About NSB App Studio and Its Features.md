If you are wondering what kind of applications you can make with NSB App Studio, here are some examples:
 
- A desktop app that runs on Windows and Mac OS using Chrome Packaged Apps[^1^]. You can design your app using HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, and distribute it through the Chrome Web Store.
- A web app that runs on any browser using jQuery Mobile or Bootstrap frameworks[^2^]. You can create responsive and interactive user interfaces that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
- A mobile app that runs on iOS and Android using PhoneGap or VoltBuilder[^2^]. You can access native device features, such as camera, GPS, accelerometer, and more, and publish your app to the App Store or Google Play.

NSB App Studio comes with many sample programs that you can study and use[^2^] [^3^]. You can also find tutorials and courses on how to use NSB App Studio on the official website[^2^].

One of the unique features of NSB App Studio is that it allows you to program in either JavaScript or BASIC. Both languages have their advantages and disadvantages, and you can choose the one that suits your preferences and goals.
 
JavaScript is the standard language of the web, and it has many benefits, such as:

- Speed - JavaScript is executed on the client-side, which means it is very fast and does not depend on server calls.
- Popularity - JavaScript is widely used and supported by all major browsers and platforms. There are many resources, libraries, and frameworks available for JavaScript developers.
- Versatility - JavaScript can be used for various kinds of applications, from web to mobile to desktop. It can also interact with other languages and technologies.

However, JavaScript also has some drawbacks, such as:

- Client-Side Security - JavaScript code is visible and accessible to anyone who views the source of a web page. This can expose your code to malicious attacks or unauthorized modifications.
- Browser Support - JavaScript may behave differently on different browsers or versions. This can cause compatibility issues or unexpected errors.
- Syntax - JavaScript has a complex and sometimes inconsistent syntax that can be confusing or frustrating for beginners or programmers coming from other languages.

BASIC, on the other hand, is a simple and easy-to-learn language that has been popular for decades. Some of the advantages of BASIC are:

- Simplicity - BASIC has a clear and straightforward syntax that is easy to read and write. It does not have many complicated rules or features that can cause confusion.
- Compatibility - BASIC code written in NSB App Studio can be converted to JavaScript automatically. This means you can use BASIC to create web apps that run on any browser or device.
- Familiarity - BASIC is similar to other popular languages like Java or C#. If you have experience with these languages, you can easily adapt to BASIC.

However, BASIC also has some disadvantages, such as:

- Limited Features - BASIC does not have some of the advanced features or functionalities that JavaScript offers, such as object-oriented programming, closures, promises, generators, etc.
- Limited Resources - BASIC is not as widely used or supported as JavaScript. There are fewer resources, libraries, and frameworks available for BASIC developers.
- Limited Performance - BASIC code is translated to JavaScript before it can run on a browser. This can add some overhead or reduce the performance of your app.
