# Tafsir al-Munir: A Comprehensive and Modern Quranic Commentary by Wahbah Zuhaili
 
Tafsir al-Munir is a contemporary Quranic commentary written by the Syrian scholar Wahbah Zuhaili (1932-2015). It is considered one of the most comprehensive and balanced tafsirs in the modern era, as it combines the methods of tafsir bil ma'thur (based on narrations) and tafsir bil ma'qul (based on reason).
 
The tafsir consists of 15 volumes, covering the entire Quran in a detailed and systematic way. It provides linguistic, historical, theological, legal, and spiritual insights into the verses, as well as addressing the issues of modernity and contemporary challenges. It also incorporates the views of various schools of thought and sects within Islam, as well as other religions and sciences.
